# Problem Statement 
  In today's consumer-driven society, there is a pressing issue of excessive waste generation due to the disposal of functional items. Simultaneously, people often struggle to access affordable goods. Bridging this gap is essential to reduce waste and promote affordability, making it imperative to establish an efficient platform for buying and selling second-hand items

# Solution

Our proposed solution is a comprehensive waste management system with three key interfaces:

Garbage Collector Interface: This interface is designed for waste collectors. It allows them to view real-time data on waste generation, optimize collection routes, and communicate with residents. It also enables collectors to list and sell recyclable items they collect.

Resident Interface: For the general public, this interface provides a platform to request waste collection, dispose of waste responsibly, and access information on nearby waste collectors. Residents can also sell their recyclable items through this interface.

Municipal Authority Interface: This interface is intended for municipal authorities. It provides access to data analytics, reports, and statistics related to waste generation and collection within their jurisdiction. It allows for effective planning and resource allocation.

# Key Features of the System:

Geolocation: The system utilizes GPS technology to track waste collector and resident locations, ensuring efficient routing and proximity-based alerts.

Real-time Communication: All interfaces allow for real-time communication between waste collectors, residents, and municipal authorities.

Online Marketplace: Residents can list recyclable items for sale, and waste collectors can purchase them for recycling or resale.

Data Analytics: Municipal authorities can access data analytics tools to monitor waste management operations, track performance, and make informed decisions.

Environmental Impact: The system encourages responsible waste disposal and recycling, thereby reducing the environmental impact of improper waste management.
