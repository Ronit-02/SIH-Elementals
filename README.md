- Introduction 

Waste management has become a critical issue in urban and rural areas alike. Rapid population growth and urbanization have led to an increase in waste generation, which poses significant environmental and health challenges. Traditional waste disposal methods are no longer sustainable, and there is a pressing need for innovative solutions to manage waste effectively.

Our project stems from the realization that existing waste management systems often lack efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. In many places, waste collectors struggle to find waste sources, while residents find it challenging to dispose of their waste responsibly. This project aims to bridge these gaps by creating an integrated waste management system that connects waste generators, waste collectors, and municipal authorities.

A study featured in the Journal of Urban Management (December 2021) reports that the 62 MT of waste generated annually includes 7.9 MT of hazardous waste, 5.6 MT of plastic waste, 1.5 MT of e-waste, and 0.17 MT of biomedical waste. The Indian Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recently projected that annual waste generation in India will increase to 165 MT by 2030. Hazardous, plastic, e-waste, and bio-medical waste generated is expected to increase proportionately, as well. 

# Solution

Our proposed solution is a comprehensive waste management system with three key interfaces:

Garbage Collector Interface: This interface is designed for waste collectors. It allows them to view real-time data on waste generation, optimize collection routes, and communicate with residents. It also enables collectors to list and sell recyclable items they collect.

Resident Interface: For the general public, this interface provides a platform to request waste collection, dispose of waste responsibly, and access information on nearby waste collectors. Residents can also sell their recyclable items through this interface.

Municipal Authority Interface: This interface is intended for municipal authorities. It provides access to data analytics, reports, and statistics related to waste generation and collection within their jurisdiction. It allows for effective planning and resource allocation.

# Key Features of the System:

Geolocation: The system utilizes GPS technology to track waste collector and resident locations, ensuring efficient routing and proximity-based alerts.

Real-time Communication: All interfaces allow for real-time communication between waste collectors, residents, and municipal authorities.

Online Marketplace: Residents can list recyclable items for sale, and waste collectors can purchase them for recycling or resale.

Data Analytics: Municipal authorities can access data analytics tools to monitor waste management operations, track performance, and make informed decisions.

Environmental Impact: The system encourages responsible waste disposal and recycling, thereby reducing the environmental impact of improper waste management.
